	/// Indicates that an interrupt should be generated if the user types a `BREAK`
	///
	/// This has no effect if ``isIgnoringIncomingBreaks`` is `true`.
	///
	/// if this is true, then a `BREAK` will flush all input and output queues. In addition, if the terminal is the controlling terminal of a foreground process
	/// group, the `BREAK` condition generates a single `SIGINT` signal for that foreground process group, which usually kills the process group.
	///
	/// If this is `false`, a `BREAK` condition is taken as input depending on ``markParityErrors``: a single input character `NULL` if it's `false`
	/// or three input characters `\377`, `NULL`, `NULL` if it's `true`.

	/// Enables input parity checking
	///
	/// If this is `false`, it allows output parity generation without input parity errors. The enabling of input parity checking is independent of the enabling

	///
	/// If a previous `STOP` character has been received, then receipt of any input character will cause the `STOP` condition to be removed. For pseudoterminals, data
	/// in the output queue is passed to the application during master `read()` processing, and slave pseudoterminal writes are allowed to proceed. The character which
	/// caused the output to restart is also processed normally as well (unless it is a `STOP` character).

	/// one or more START characters when it appears that there is space in the input queues for more input.
	///
	/// - LINK TO SYMBOLS:
	/// The character used as the `STOP` character is dictated by the `c_cc` member of the termios structure. It is intended to tell the terminal
	/// to stop sending input for a while.  Again, the character used as the START character is dictated by the `c_cc` member. It is intended to
	/// tell the terminal that it can resume transmission of input.
	@inlinable public var isInputControlEnabled: Bool {
		get { rawValue.ixoff }

	}

	/// Enables start/stop output control
	///
	/// If the system receives a `STOP` character as input, it will suspend output on the associated terminal until a `START` character is received.
	/// An application reading input from the terminal does not see `STOP` or `START` characters; they are intercepted by the system, which does
	/// all the necessary processing.
	///
	/// If this is `false`, any `STOP` or `START` characters read are passed on as input to an application reading from the terminal.

	/// Marks characters with parity errors
	///
	/// This has no effect if ``isIgnoringInputParityErrors`` is `true`.
	///
	/// If this is `true`, then a byte with a framing or parity error is sent to the application as the characters `\377` and `NULL`, followed by the data part of
	/// the byte that had the parity error. If `ISTRIP` is `false`, a valid input character of `\377` is sent as a pair of characters `\377`, `\377` to avoid ambiguity.
	///
	/// If this is `false`, a character with a framing or parity error is sent to the application as `NULL`.
